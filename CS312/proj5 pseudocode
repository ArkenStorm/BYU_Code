Pseudo code for greedy algorithm

initialize set of all nodes
initialNode = None
currNode = None
while set of all nodes is not empty
	pop off a node and store in initialNode if None, also mark as visited
	find neighbor of node with lowest cost, pop it if not visited and update currNode
	add to total cost
